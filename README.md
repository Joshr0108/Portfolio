# Django Project Website

A simple website to showcase personal projects, built with Django


# Project Summary
This website will showcase all of my project, starting with this website. I'll use it to document and display the portfolio while highlighting the key skills used for each one and what was learnt while showing I can present them in a way employers would like.
The homepage should quickly show the projects and lead to all the details once clicked on.
